		<p>I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday.
		But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.</p>
	    <p>If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and films. 
	    And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.</p>
